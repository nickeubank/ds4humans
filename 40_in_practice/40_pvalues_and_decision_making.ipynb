    "Below is a regression estimating the effects of a 2007 experiment in which a random sample of ultra-poor households in West Bengal were given livestock and 30 or 40 week stipend of 90 rupees a week for 18 months. Development economists then tracked these households — along with a set of control households — for many years. The code below regresses household expenditures three years after the experiment began on whether a given household was \"treated\" (received the livestock and stipend).[^sample]\n",
    "\n",
    "[^sample]: A small confession: I down-sampled the original data to get interesting p-values. The original study was very successful and the p-values on the full study were very, very small, which makes it harder to use as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Development economists measure income by what people are able to buy, grow, and consume every month, since poor households often don't earn a cash wage.) "
