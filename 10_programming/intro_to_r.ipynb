    "\n",
    "But the way we'll mostly *use* R is with an application called [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). RStudio is a \"helper\" program that makes it easier to work with R (it is what is referred to as an \"editor\" or \"integrated development environment\" (IDE)). When you're working in RStudio, all the code you run is being run by R itself, but RStudio provides tools to make it easier to see what R is doing, to organize the code your write to run in R, to look at plots R generates, and more. In other words, you don't need RStudio to use R (some people use other editors, like VS Code), but you definitely need R to run RStudio, and any code you write in RStudio will work anywhere R is available. \n",

    "Now things get a little more interesting. Instead of a single value being assigned to a variable, we now have an *expression* on the right side of the assignment operator. The way R handles this is by first evaluating the expression on the right side of the assignment operator (`<-`), then assigning it to the variable. \n",

We will have lots of opportunities to practice what you've read, and I don't expect you to feel comfortable with any of this until you've had a chance do some exercises. Programming is a skill that you learn by doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have worked with R before, I recognize that this might feel a little slow -- please bear with me!

We'll get into material I feel confident will be novel soon.\n",

    "It's normal at this point to find yourself saying \"wait... this isn't what I signed up for when I chose to pursue social science! This feels like computer science.\" Hang in there -- I promise we'll get to good, applied social science examples within a couple classes.  \n",

    "No discipline is changing faster than data science / computational social science. As a result, I don't want to just teach you how to chain together a handful of specific functions to do basic data manipulations. That might be the faster path to getting to work with social science datasets, but when those functions change in the future (which they inevitably will), or your research demands you move on to other tools, you won't have the understanding of how R works required to adapt. \n",
    "\n",
    "But by learning the fundamental principles of *how* programming languages work, you'll develop a more robust, less \"brittle\" skill set that will provide you with a solid foundation for learning new tools over the course of your entire social science career. It may feel a little slow at first, but I promise it'll pay off over the years. "
