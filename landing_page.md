# Welcome to DS4Humans

This website is both the course site for the Duke Interdisciplinary Data Science Course *Solving Problems with Data* (IDS 701), as well as the beginning of what I hope will eventually become a stand-alone textbook by [Nick Eubank](https://www.nickeubank.com).

**If you *aren't* a Duke IDS 701 student** and wish to explore the content of the course, I'd suggest starting with the [Introduction chapter here](10_introduction/10_solving_problems_with_data). You're also welcome to browse the class schedule of topics covered in the class in the [class schedule](00_class_schedule/class_schedule) link, or hop down to the readings in **Data Science in Practice** towards the bottom of the left-hand navigation menu for a few stand-alone readings on various professionalization topics, like [Writing to Stakeholders](40_in_practice/25_writing_to_stakeholders) or [Providing Feedback](40_in_practice/30_giving_feedback).

If you *are* a Duke student, here's are links to some course materials:

### Non-MIDS Students Interested in IDS 701

If you are not a Masters of Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) student and are interested in 701, you should be aware that this class assumes:

- Comfort with Python and the Python Data Science stack (numpy, pandas, jupyter, matplotlib, etc.),
- Prior coursework in statistical inference and linear regression, and
- A prior or concurrent class in machine learning.

If you feel you meet all three requirements, please email me with the details of your background.

### Course Schedule

You can find the [course schedule here](00_class_schedule/class_schedule). Note that our schedule is subject to change, but this should give you a good sense of the material we will cover.
