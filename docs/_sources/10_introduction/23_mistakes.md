## Reading Reflection Questions

At the end of many readings in this book you will find a set of "reading reflection questions." As the name implies, these are questions meant to help readers reflect on what they've read, as well as to draw attention to key points from the chapter.

- What is the purpose of this book? What problem in data science education does it aim to address?
- What is **the** most important task for a data scientist hoping to successfully help their stakeholder?
- In the view of this book, all data science tools are tools for doing what? Do you agree?
- What are the three types of questions a data scientist is likely to encounter? What is the primary purpose of each type of question?
- Does one always move through the questions presented here in the same order?
