## Opioid Reductions

Suppose you have been hired by a medical regulatory board concerned about the rise in opioid overdoses. They are debating whether they *should* (there's that magic word!) make it harder for patients to get opioids. Fundamentally, however, they worry that while restrictions on opioids may reduce overdoses and addiction, they may also prevent some patients with very real pain conditions from getting the care they need.

Why are they stuck? Well, there may be two causes:

1) They may be unsure how to value overdose prevention versus ensuring appropriate patient access to opioids, and/or
2) they may also be unsure about *how much* opioid regulations that reduce overdoses by a certain amount would limit access for patients in need.

The first of these questions is a pure Prescriptive Question — if you could prevent one overdose death at the expense of preventing 10 patients in pain from getting the opioids they need, would you accept that trade-off?

But the second is actually a Descriptive Question that you — the data scientist — *can* answer! You could study policies that have been implemented in the past and come up with a rigorous estimate of how much opioid regulations that reduce overdoses also reduce access for patients in need. You could also evaluate different kinds of policies to figure out which is most efficient — maybe some policies (like not allowing any opioid prescriptions at all) are good at stopping overdose deaths but also *really* limit appropriate access, while other policies are similarly good at reducing overdoses but have a much smaller effect on limiting access.

## The Example of Carbon Emissions

A profoundly difficult Prescriptive Question in debates over carbon reduction is whether developing countries should be held to the same emission reduction targets as more developed countries. On the one hand, developing countries like China and India are the source of most current growth in carbon emissions, and so policies that do not apply to developing countries are unlikely to prevent many of the worst climate change outcomes. On the other hand, these countries produce radically less carbon *per capita* than Europe or the United States, and the industrial growth creating those emissions has been a major factor in lifting billions of people out of extreme poverty.

Hard choices indeed! How does one weigh the improvements in the quality of life of those in extreme poverty against the possible consequences of even greater climate catastrophes?

While that question, in part, is a Prescriptive Question that no regression can answer, data scientists *can* bring data to bear on this question indirectly by helping everyone understand the potential consequences of different carbon targets for developing countries, as well as the feasibility of different strategies for carbon reduction. A data scientist could, for example:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of different messages politicians in the US and Europe could use to convince their constituents to support greater carbon reduction targets,
- Quantify the magnitude of the effect on global warming caused by different emissions targets for developing countries to help politicians in developing countries weigh the poverty-reducing benefits of carbon-intensive industrialization against the likely direct effect of flooding, droughts, or more severe storms on their own citizens, or
- Estimate the cost-effectiveness of developed countries sharing lower emissions industrial technologies with developing countries to ameliorate the tradeoff between poverty reduction and emissions.

In each of these cases, the data scientist is only answering Descriptive Questions, but in doing so they are helping everyone better understand the consequences of their decisions, and in doing so (hopefully) help the world to make more informed decisions about the trade-offs they are making.
