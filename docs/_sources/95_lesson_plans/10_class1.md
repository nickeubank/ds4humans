# First Class

## Ex 1

- You are all enrolled in a data science Master's program. But can you tell me: what *is* data science? What do you hope to be able to do once you graduate you weren't able to do before?

## Introduce

- Class outline:
  - Solving **problems** by answering questions using quantitative methods.

- Working with Stakeholders to properly articulate the problem you wish to solve.
- In collaboration with your stakeholder, determine what questions, if asked, would help solve their problem.
  - Descriptive Questions: Questions about the distribution of outcomes in the world, relevant for prioritizing subsequent efforts.
  - (Passive) Prediction Questions: Questions about something that *may* happen in the future, or which are otherwise unobserved.
  - Causal Questions

## Ex 2: Why do we care about causal questions?

- What problems does answering a causal question help us solve?
- Why is answering a causal question different?
