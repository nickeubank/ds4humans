# Giving Effective Feedback (Data Science Edition)

One of the best ways to thrive in the workplace is to help those around you be successful. This can, at times, feel counter-intuitive — we all have a natural tendency to measure ourselves against those around us, which can result in a feeling of implicit competitiveness with peers. But helping your colleagues be more effective isn't just a good thing to do from an ethical perspective — it will also make your teams and units more effective, improve your professional reputation, make people eager to involve you in new projects, and make colleagues more likely to reciprocate with your generosity. 

Providing detailed, constructive feedback is one of the best ways to help colleagues. Yet it's a skill we rarely teach. In this reading, I provide a framework for giving feedback that's specific to empirical data science. As with everything in this book, you may eventually decide this approach to feedback is not for you, and that you already have a style of feedback you enjoy. But give it a try and if nothing else, it will give you a foil to help you understand what you *don't* like in feedback!

## Levels of Feedback

The key to effective feedback on data science projects, in my view, is to recognize the multiple levels on which all data science projects operate (and where they can fall apart):

- **Approach - Problem fit:** given the problem that motivates the project, will the question the author is seeking to answer actually help address the problem?
- **Does the project have a good strategy for answering the question?**: Is the strategy being employed a good one for answering the question they have set out to answer (at least in theory)? 
- **Was the strategy executed successfully/Do you believe the answer generated?**: Basically, do you believe the answer generated by the analysis? Are there issues with the result, data, or diagnostics that give you pause?

A project can have issues at any (or all) of these three levels, and each step of this ladder from motivation to estimated answer is a place where feedback can be provided.

Richard McElreath, author of the amazing book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/), argues you can divide statistical analyses into a similar ladder of abstraction (it's a touch different from mine, but similar). He refers to the levels of an analysis as:

- **The Estimand**: What are you trying to measure in substantive — not statistical — terms. For example, "gender wage discrimination" or "the effect of opioids on neurologic pain." 
- **The Estimator**: The specific model and specification you've chosen to use to measure that quantity, like linear regression or logistic regression.
- **The Estimate**: the actual number that you get from the model. 

Delightfully, he also uses [this figure](https://youtu.be/mBEA7PKDmiY?si=pykJpxpC9uBJVQKM&t=206) to emphasize the inevitable... challenges that emerge at each transition from theory to empirical reality:

Students tend to feel most comfortable at the lowest of these levels of abstraction — data science classes tend to emphasize factor engineering and model diagnostics, so students have the most practice raising concrete concerns about model fitting and implementation. Yet that is also the domain where most other data scientists are likely to feel most comfortable, and so while feedback at this level is valuable, learning to reflect more on project motivation and how the project fits with the motivating problem often gives one a comparative advantage in providing useful feedback.

## Start with a Summarization

Before you offer suggestions, begin by laying out how you understand the project. Using this framework, lay out what you understand to be:

- the problem motivating the project ("This project aims to address [problem]..."), 
- how the project aspires to address this problem ("In order to address this problem, the seek to answer the question [question authors intend to answer]..."), 
- how they attempt to do so ("Using data from [such and such], the authors set out to answer this question using [modelling strategy]),
- what they find *expressed in concrete terms* ("They find that the partial correlation between X and Y is Z.")
- how they interpret what they find ("They interpret this as evidence that the answer to their question is that [something something]"),
- how they relate it back to the problem ("Given that, they argue [something about their motivating problem]...")

At each stage, try not to fill in any gaps in the logic of your colleague's arguments — the goal here is to make sure, concretely, you see the project precisely for all its parts. 

This exercise is useful for two reasons. First, it helps *you* think through the project in very concrete terms. Humans are exceptionally good at seeing patterns in the world even when they don't exist, and when reading your brain will naturally try to gloss over inconsistencies in the logic of what you are reading. Decomposing a project into granular components in this manner helps counteract that tendency, bringing attention to logical fallacies or gaps you might otherwise overlook. 

Second, summarizing how you understand a project helps the project authors understand what they have communicated to the reader and the basis for the feedback you provide. Moreover, it makes it clear to the recipient of feedback that you gave their project your full attention, which is likely to make them more receptive to critiques.

## Offer Higher-Level Thoughts On The Analysis

It's easy to get lost in the weeds — "fix that figure caption," "did you try logging that variable?," or "what about using [trendy new model]?" 

But before you get into more detailed feedback, I find it helpful to provide feedback on the overall strategy of the analysis. In general, this amounts to thinking about whether the different levels of an analysis link up. For example, do you think answering the question the author sets out to answer will really help address the problem that motivated their analysis? Do you think their empirical strategy can actually answer the question they set out to answer?

### Say What You Think The Analysis Did Well

As you work on this, remember to not just comment on problems — talk about the analysis' strengths too! It's easy to focus on the short-comings of an analysis, but emphasizing the positive not only prevents the recipient from feeling attacked, it also helps them understand the elements of their analysis that they should retain or emphasize.

### Be Constructive

Whenever you raise a concern, try to also provide some thoughts about how the concern could be addressed. It helps people to know about problems with their analyses before they show them to higher-ups, don't get me wrong, but nothing makes people more grateful than identifying a problem *and* offering a solution. Your suggestion doesn't have to be perfect. Even a so-so suggestion makes the point you see yourself as part of a collaborative enterprise (you're working together towards getting it right!) and may inspire new lines of thinking.

## Then Get Granular, if Appropriate

Once you're done with strategic, high-level reflections, *then* you can turn to the granular. But remember, the goal isn't to score points — if you've just suggested that the analysis needs to go in a fundamentally different direction, nitpicking about feature engineering just comes across as petty and annoying.
