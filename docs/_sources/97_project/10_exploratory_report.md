# Assignment 2: Exploratory Question Report

The second project assignment is to answer the Exploratory Questions laid out in your initial proposal. The report should be written to an imaginary but specified stakeholder (please state at the top of the report who you imagine your stakeholder to be). 

It should answer at least three Exploratory Questions. Of the three Exploratory Questions you seek to answer, **at least one** must be answered through your own analysis (i.e., you must load data into Python/R and generate your answers). You *may* answer up to two by citing reputable sources (if someone else has already found the answer, why re-invent the wheel?!).

The report should be written according to the [principles in this document](../40_in_practice/25_writing_to_stakeholders) (which will be familiar to those of you who took *Practical Data Science*). Please start your document with a quick note on who you imagine as your stakeholder (a CEO, a public policy expert, etc.).

## Finding Data

To help you along your way, here's a [compilation of a huge number of public data sources](99_data.md). It's far from exhaustive, but a good place to browse if you're unsure how to answer one of your questions.

Still stuck? Let me know and we can brainstorm together.

## Length and Format

I'm relatively flexible on length â€” I imagine most will be in the three to six-page range, including appendices and figures and provide additional information.

## Due Date

Your Exploratory Question Report is due **February 13th**.
