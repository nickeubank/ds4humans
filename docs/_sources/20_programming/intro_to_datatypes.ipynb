In this section, we'll go over the four data types you'll encounter most -- `numeric`, `integer`, `character`, and `logical` types -- as well as what it means for R to have these distinct data types. \n",

                "`numeric` data, as the name implies, is data that stores numbers. This may be people's ages or incomes, countries' GDPs and infant mortality rates, global temperatures, or survey responses on a scale from 1 to 7. `numeric` data supports mathematical operations, like multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting, etc. \n",
                "\n",
                "`integer` data is just a special kind of numeric data that only contains, well... integers! (e.g. 1, 2, 3). We won't worry much about `integer` as a special type in this bootcamp -- if something can be represented as an `integer` it can be represented as a `numeric` -- but sometimes you'll see it, so it's good to be aware of.\n",
                "\n",
                "`character` data is text data. It could be something short, like a survey respondent's name, or something longer, like the content of a tweet or a politician's speech.  \n",

                "`logical` data takes on only two values: `TRUE` and `FALSE` (note those values have to be written in all capitals to be recognized by R!). `logical` data can store information about the world (you could have a variable called `female` that only has values of `TRUE` and `FALSE`), but more often we use it for evaluating our data. For example, suppose we wanted to test whether a survey respondent's age is over 18 to evaluate whether they are eligible to vote -- we'd probably do something like ask whether `age >= 18`, which would evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE`."
