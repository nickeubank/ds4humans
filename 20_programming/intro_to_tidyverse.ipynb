    "# dplyr and the Tidyverse\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous readings, we learned how to accomplish tasks like subsetting and modifying variables using what's called \"array indexing\" (using those `[]` square brackets). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, another approach to manipulating dataframes in R that is very popular: using a set of functions provided by the `dplyr` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "dplyr is one of a collection of libraries known collectively as the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) designed to essentially provide a way of working with data in R that's a little different from the array-indexing approach we've been focused on up to this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear *dplyr doesn't allow you to do anything you couldn't do with array indexing, it just provides different ways to write your commands.* But the way it allows you to write commands is something that many people find quite compelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Philosophy of dplyr\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into dplyr, however, a quick word on the philosophy of dplyr and the tidyverse more generally. The tidyverse is *very* popular, but it also has some detractors. The basic concern people have with dplyr is that it provides a big library specialized commands for doing specific dataframe manipulations. *But*...\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, learning the tidyverse amounts to learning lots of specific functions rather than generalized concepts. In most cases, tidyverse packages don't embrace *generalized abstractions*, like array indexing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen in our past readings, in regular R the logic that dictates how vectors work informs how matrices work, which in turn informs how dataframes work. And if you move into three or four dimensional arrays for modeling time series or real world volumes at some point, what you know about vectors and matrices will also apply there. Indeed, the concept of an array and the idea of array indexing is such a fundamental abstraction in data science that you'll also find it in languages like Python, Matlab, and Julia you may sometime end up using.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, over-reliance on the tidyverse may limit students' opportunity to learn to combine basic building blocks to accomplish sophisticated tasks. If you only want to do things for which the tidyverse provides an explicit function, that's not a problem, but it limits ones' understanding of how to get R to do things that *aren't* covered by a specific function in R, which is often what is required when doing social science research.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you want to read a more eloquent version of this critique, [you can find one here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-thousand-gadgets-my-thoughts-on-the-r-tidyverse-2441d8504433).)\n",
    "\n",
    "None of that is to suggest you should avoid dplyr or the rest of the tidyverse entirely. To the contrary, I think the tidyverse plotting library (`ggplot`) is the best plotting library around, and I'm a fan of several dplyr functions (especially `rename`, which makes an otherwise tedious task quite simple). \n",
    "\n",
    "But as you use it, be mindful of its different philosophy of programming it embodies, and how using it shapes the way you think about using R."

    "Chaining always begins with specifying the data frame we want to operate on (e.g.,\n",
    "`countries`).  Every subsequent statement will then operate on this data frame, starting with the function that comes right after the data frame and working its way down.  In our case, the first thing we'll do to `countries` is to subset it. We'll then sort it by country name. Lastly, we'll overwrite the country name to be lower-case and create a new variable representing GDP per capita in 1000s.\n",

    "Personally, my preference is actually to break down long chains of manipulations into a series of distinct commands. Why? Because it allows me to look at each intermediate step and make sure I didn't mess something up. And as we'll discuss in a later reading, I think you should *always* assume you've messed something up, because humans are bad at programming! And if you chain a bunch of manipulations, there's no way to look at the intermediate outputs to check for errors. \n",

    "In conclusion, dplyr allows you to write more concise commands with more familiar terminology -- `select` and `filter` rather than array notation. Chaining, similarly, can definitely make code more concise. As a result, many people are drawn to dplyr, and you may be too!\n",
    "\n",
    "So should you use it? Well, first of all, this isn't a yes or no question -- you may decide there are a couple `dplyr` functions you really love, but that you don't like all of them. And more generally, at this point you know a lot about these different approaches to dataframe manipulation, and how tidyverse modifies how R works. That means you can make *your own* educated decision based on your *own* preferences.\n",

    "As for me, I use elements of the tidyverse -- especially `ggplot` for plotting, which we'll cover in a later lesson -- with some frequency. But I'm comfortable doing so because I know that anytime I need to do something that doesn't feel natural within the tidyverse framework, or where I run into problems (we'll discuss how easily that happens when you're writing loops in a later lesson), I know I'm not reliant on the tidyverse and can turn to other tools when necessary.\n",
