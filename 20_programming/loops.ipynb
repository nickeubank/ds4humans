So when you're writing a loop, I recommend following the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the first line of your loop. This will help you visualize what you're looping over and what your looping variable (e.g. `i` in the example above) will be. \n",
    "2. Write the code that you want to put inside your loop on its own. So that it runs the same way it will eventually run inside the loop, define your looping variable (`i`) to be equal to the first entry in the vector you're looping over (e.g. `i <- names[1]`). In that way the code you're writing will have access to the same variable that it will have later.\n",
    "3. Move the code you have written separately into the loop (without that initial assignment `i <- names[1]`, obviously). \n",
