                "A prominent economic theory predicts that higher income inequality should be associated with more redistribution from the rich to the poor (Meltzer and Richard 1981). Letâ€™s create a dataset that will allow us to test this prediction using U.S. state-level data. Our goal is to look at the correlation between income inequality and state taxes per capita (i.e. the amount of taxes each state collects from each resident on average). I am happy if we just look at this for one year (say 2010).\n",

                "- State populations.\n",
