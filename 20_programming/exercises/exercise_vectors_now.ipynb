The [best way to learn is to do so actively](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/Active-Learning.pdf) – if you just look at answers as soon as you get stuck, your process is more passive. You may feel like you’re learning more, but research shows that that’s an illusion – students who learn passively think they’re learning more than they are ([a summary of work in this area is here](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/study-shows-that-students-learn-more-when-taking-part-in-classrooms-that-employ-active-learning-strategies/)). \n",
