And to provide value to a stakeholder, a data scientist's analysis must have both.\n\nInstead, to answer Causal Questions we have to find situations that *approximate* one of these two states of the world. For example, if we were running a website we could change how the website looks for some users, then compare those users' behavior to the behavior of a different group of users who still see the old version of the site. In doing so, we're using the second group of users as a stand-in for what we think the first users would be doing if they still encountered the old site.\n\nSimilarly, we could measure a patient's cholesterol prior to giving the patient an experimental cholesterol drug, then measure it again after they've been on the medication for a few weeks as a way of estimating the effect of the drug. Essentially, we're using the patient before receiving the medication as a stand-in for what we think the patient's cholesterol would have been a few weeks later if they hadn't received the new drug.\n\nBut as we will see, none of these strategies are perfect. In the example of changing the website design for only some users, it's always possible that differences in user behavior between the two groups wasn't the result of the different website, but other differences in the users (like age or gender). And while we can compare our patient's cholesterol before and after taking the experimental drug, it's always possible that the patient's cholesterol was going to change over time anyway, regardless of the medication!\n\nAs these simple examples illustrate while answering Causal Questions is one of the most exciting things we get to do in data science, it is also one of the hardest. And perhaps more than in any other domain of data science, answering Causal Questions—a practice referred to as *causal inference*—will require a *lot* of critical thinking on the part of the data scientist, and a lot of humility.
