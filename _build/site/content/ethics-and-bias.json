Is it OK to down-rank Black recipients? (not a contrived example). In that context, providing black recipients with less access to kidneys seems deeply problematic, even if rating them higher will result in less “years of healthy kidneys” after transplant. Here it seems like racially disparate outcomes are unethical. But what if we want to allocate HIV preventative interventions? Black Americans have a much higher incidence of HIV than any other ethnic group in the US—a model that suggests targeting their communities with more interventions would seem appropriate, on a model that doesn’t recognize that HIV rates in the Black community are more than 2x the next closest group seems like it wouldn’t be very helpful.","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"TxT3cN7eZf"}],"key":"c4IfC9Gyap"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Chicago crime example: ","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"key":"yaAiMoUVs7"},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22444020/chicago-pd-predictive-policing-heat-list","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://​www​.theverge​.com​/c​/22444020​/chicago​-pd​-predictive​-policing​-heat​-list","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"key":"sAHP1KlO1G"}],"urlSource":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22444020/chicago-pd-predictive-policing-heat-list","key":"Jk9hjL6LrQ"}],"key":"ljUvyqgc7D"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"link","url":"https://filtermag.org/chicago-crime-prediction/","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://​filtermag​.org​/chicago​-crime​-prediction​/","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"key":"QvccZmfTit"}],"urlSource":"https://filtermag.org/chicago-crime-prediction/","key":"bBWoNZdlRj"}],"key":"xqTJAMzBQ4"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"link","url":"https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/predicting-arrests-looking-into-chicagos-crime-through-machine-learning-78697cc930b9","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://​medium​.com​/analytics​-vidhya​/predicting​-arrests​-looking​-into​-chicagos​-crime​-through​-machine​-learning​-78697cc930b9","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"key":"zDtupeqZIO"}],"urlSource":"https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/predicting-arrests-looking-into-chicagos-crime-through-machine-learning-78697cc930b9","key":"EltOBCexwc"}],"key":"Eoq4DctqqY"}],"key":"BchzN8Y8tw"}],"key":"NCRisOGrkB"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Opacity","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":22,"column":1}},"key":"Ojc0cX21F3"},{"type":"list","ordered":false,"spread":false,"position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1},"end":{"line":23,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Can’t audit normatively","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1},"end":{"line":23,"column":1}},"key":"pKjHaw4zda"}],"key":"xh2SuQJOVy"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Can’t audit for accuracy: ","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"key":"xXcBKauJmQ"},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/opinion/how-computers-are-harming-criminal-justice.html","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://​www​.nytimes​.com​/2017​/06​/13​/opinion​/how​-computers​-are​-harming​-criminal​-justice​.html","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"key":"YCnDKsu7Wy"}],"urlSource":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/opinion/how-computers-are-harming-criminal-justice.html","key":"CVx2MQDLOC"}],"key":"sQdB58d0uU"}],"key":"BjeT4nTy4L"}],"key":"LcYX8Fs31w"}],"key":"ZLdmrAwDQy"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1},"end":{"line":28,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"But… it’s data?
