In these situations, it's critical that you always ask yourself: are the results from this study likely to also be valid in the context of my problem?\n\nOf course, when asking about the external validity of a study, we have to specify the setting to which we want to generalize its results. A study that looks at how Duke undergraduates' consumer behavior changes when faced with different types of ads on google may have good external validity in terms of its generalizability to other elite Univerities like Emory, Vanderbilt, or UNC. But it might not generalize to the US population as a whole.\n\n### External Validity Considerations\n\nThere are many reasons that the results of a study may not generalize to a new context. Here are a handful of the most common issues to bear in mind:\n\n**The study population may be different from the population in the new context.**\n\nAlmost by definition, the entities in the new context will be different from the entities in the original study (even if we're working with the same people, we're looking at them at a different time). But the key question for external validity is whether the entities in the new context are different *in a way that would impact their response to a given treatment*.\n\nIt's not hard to think of reasons that different populations may respond differently to a given treatment. For example, suppose a company finds ads for luxury cars increase sales among rich people in New York. It's hard to imagine that the same ad run in a poor neighborhood in Detroit would have the same effect.\n\nAs you think about population differences, make sure you consider not only standard demographic attributes (age, gender, wealth, education), but also cultural or social differences. Many issues businesses deal with -- especially advertising and brand image -- may be culturally specific, and so may not generalize to all communities.\n\nThis may all seem obvious as you read it, but using unrepresentative samples in research and medicine, then making recommendations for the general public is a huge problem in the real world.\n\nWhite men are massively over-represented in [medical trials](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/why-are-health-studies-so-white/487046/), for example. Unsurprisingly, this means that when the results of those trials are generalized to the population as a whole, we suddenly discover (SURPRISE) that the predicted results didn't always hold for women or people of color! (e.g. [drug doses set for men are often too high for women](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/30/fda-clinical-trials-gender-gap-epa-nih-institute-of-medicine-cardiovascular-disease); some heart drugs work great for White men, [but often interact poorly with a gene common in Asians and Pacific Islanders; and Multiple sclerosis turns out to be drive by a different mutation in Black patients than European descendants](https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbjjnp/medical-studies-still-exclude-people-of-color)).\n\nAnd for the longest time, psychology research was based almost entirely on studies conducted using student volunteers. But of course, students at elite universities are not a representative population -- they're disproportionately Western, Educated, from Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic countries (they're WEIRD). And as a result, our academic model of human behavior is really just a [model of a bunch of WEIRD kids](https://slate.com/technology/2013/05/weird-psychology-social-science-researchers-rely-too-much-on-western-college-students.html).\n\nUnrepresentative training data is also one of the reasons that so many machine learning algorithms are just plain racist (this isn't causal inference, but it's the same idea) -- if you train a facial recognition algorithm using predominantly white faces, turns out that they will either [not see Black faces](http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/22/hp.webcams/index.html), or worse, mis-identify people of color (which is a [really bad thing when those algorithms are being used by the police](https://www.wired.com/story/best-algorithms-struggle-recognize-black-faces-equally/)).\n\nSo while internal validity issues may seem more sophisticated and thus interesting, don't overlook the importance of these kinds of external validity issues!\n\n**The treatment might differ between study and new context**\n\nA study may declare that it has measured the effect of billboard ads on sales, or an infinite scroll on engagement. But it's always important to remember that while we may interprete studies in these general terms, the reality is that that billboard study probably measured the effect *of a specific set of billboard ads* on sales, and the infinite scroll study looked at the effect of infinite scroll *in a specific app*.\n\nSo always be careful to think about what *exactly* the treatment in a study was, and whether its likely to generalize to the case you study about.\n\n**There may be scaling effects**\n\nOften times when we're thinking about external validity, we're not just thinking re-using a treatment or intervention; we're thinking about scaling them up.\n\nBut an intervention that works on a few people / is only in place for a short period may not be a perfect model for what happens when that same intervention is applied at scale or permanently. For example, the returns to showing people a TV ad about your company for the first time is probably not the same as the returns to airing that ad the 1,000,000th time. Or sales from selling a special product at one store for a limited time may not be a good indicator of the sales you would see if your \"special product\" were available everywhere all the time.\n\nPeople may also respond differently to an intervention when it gets big or becomes permanent. To illustrate, I'd like to tell a story about a famous experiment in India ([paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826809/)).  \n\nRural health clinics in India have a huge problem: nurse absenteeism. To try and address the problem, in the late 2000s an NGO (along with some MIT economists) decided to see if they could fix the problem. The NGO started keeping track of when nurses clocked in and out, and then shared the information with the government, who then applied fines or punishments to nurses who weren't showing up for work.\n\nInitially, the intervention was successful, leading to very large increases in attendance (doubling it in fact!) after a few months. But as nurses came to realize this wasn't just a little study but actually something that was going to be around for a while, they mobilized politically, and soon administrators were allowing nurses to claim an increasing number of \"exempt days\", avoiding punishment. And so sure enough, nurses stopped coming to work, and absenteeism had returned to pre-intervention levels 16 months after the program began.\n\nThis is an example of what economists call a \"general equilibrium\" effect -- when we introduce a treatment to the world, the world responds. But often these responses don't happen in small trials the same way they do when policies go big, creating serious generalizability problems.\n\nRelatedly: if you are a public policy person or an economic development person, I cannot recommend [this paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22595) by Angus Deaton and Nancy Cartwright enough for discussing the limitations of RCTs for learning about the effects of policy or nature of social processes. It's a long, very thoughtful paper, but it's really, *really* good.
