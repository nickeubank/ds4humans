Statisticians have approached evaluating model fit with, unsurprisingly, methods based on the idea of random sampling and the properties of statistical distributions.

That’s the origin of statistics like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), as well as the emphasis on the validity of the standard errors assigned to factors on the right-hand side of the regression.","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"vGF3fuUBLL"}],"key":"Eg2SDhLlVJ"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When computer scientists were first developing their own machine learning techniques...
