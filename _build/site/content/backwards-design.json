This is usually done for good reasons -- the instructors design these exercises in a way that focuses student attention on the skills that they are trying to develop (like model selection or model interpretation).

They are, after all, just built of math, and math can’t be racist, can it? And so companies like amazon tried to build supervised machine learning algorithms to help them decide who to hire. The problem, though, is that they trained them using data on which people human employees had decided to hire in the past, and data from subjective employee evaluations that had been made by human supervisors. And because this gave rise to an algorithm that looked at people’s resumes and asked itself “what would Amazon’s (very human) hiring staff and supervisors have thought of this person?,” the algorithm of course inherited all the biases of those humans.
