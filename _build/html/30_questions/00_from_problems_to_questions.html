<h1>From Problems to Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#from-problems-to-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Problem Well Stated is a Problem Half Solved</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Charles Kettering, Head of Research at General Motors</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pandimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favorite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all.
And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before its data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off. […]
“O Deep Thought computer,” he said, “the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us…” he paused, “the Answer!”
“The Answer?” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to what?”
“Life!” urged Fook.
“The Universe!” said Lunkwill.
“Everything!” they said in chorus.
Deep Thought paused for a moment’s reflection. “Tricky,” he said finally.
“But can you do it?”
Again, a significant pause.
“Yes,” said Deep Thought, “I can do it.”
“There is an answer?” said Fook with breathless excitement. “A simple answer?” added Lunkwill.
“Yes,” said Deep Thought. “Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But,” he added, “I’ll have to think about it.” […]
Fook glanced impatiently at his watch. “How long?” he said.
“Seven and half million years,” said Deep Thought.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>[Seven and a half million years later]</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Never again,” cried the cheerleader, “never again will we wake up in the morning and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don’t get up and go to work? For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!” […]
There was a moment’s expectant pause while panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel. “Good morning,” said Deep Thought [a computer that was created by a pan-dimensional, hyper-intelligent species of beings] at last.
“Er …good morning, O Deep Thought,” said Loonquawl nervously, “do you have … er, that is …”
“An answer for you?” interrupted Deep Thought majestically. “Yes. I have.”
The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.
“There really is one?” breathed Phouchg.
“There really is one,” confirmed Deep Thought.
“To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?”
“Yes.”
Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.
“And you’re ready to give it to us?” urged Loonquawl.
“I am.”
“Now?”
“Now,” said Deep Thought.
They both licked their dry lips.
“Though I don’t think,” added Deep Thought, “that you’re going to like it.” […]
“All right,” said the computer, and settled into silence again.
The two men fidgeted.
The tension was unbearable.
“Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
“Forty-two!” yelled Loonquawl. “Is that all you’ve got to show for seven and a half million years’ work?”
“I checked it very thoroughly,” said the computer, “and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.”
“But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything,” howled Loonquawl.
“Yes,” said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, “but what actually is it?”
A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other.
“Well, you know, it’s just Everything … everything …” offered Phouchg weakly. “Exactly!” said Deep Thought. “So once you do know what the question actually is, you’ll know what the answer means.”</p>

<p>Douglas Adams, <strong>Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</strong></p>
<p>As a data scientist, it will probably be the case that the people you work with will not come to you with well-formed research questions they want investigated. Instead, it is much more likely they will come to you with a problem they are facing, and in some cases a poorly formed idea of how they think you can solve their problem using data science (a solution that will almost certain invoke the magic of “machine learning”).</p>
<p>If you take nothing else away from this portion of the class, let it be this: your ability to properly identify, understand, and articulate the problem you wish to solve will be <strong>the</strong> biggest determinant of your success as a data scientist.</p>
<!-- 

notes to us:

- Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy: what is the question that gives the answer you find?
- Need to be question driven!!
- "Answers" are easy.  Good questions are hard!
- "Gender" gap (or "Racial" gap)?
- What are we measuring? Why? How?  What does it mean?  What is the data?
- Demographics are not causal!
- The hardest issues are often not statistical or programming, they are critical thinking!! 

  -->
<p>When this happens, it is your job to do two things:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Figure out the <em>real</em> core problem/need of the stakeholder,</p></li>
<li><p>Determine what questions, if answered, would help you address that problem.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As a young data scientist, you will often be in the position of having to use your data science skills to help someone else. In this book, we will refer to any third-party you are helping as your “stakeholder.” This may be your manager, your CEO, or someone at another company you are advising.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#workingforyourself" id="id1">1</a> And it will nearly always be the case that your job as a data scientist will be to solve a problem for your stakeholder.</p>
<p>While this may seem obvious, there’s a catch: your stakeholder will almost never come to you with well-formed research questions they want to be investigated. Instead, it is much more likely they will come to you with a vague conception of a problem they are facing and a poorly formed idea of how they think you can solve their problem using data science (a solution that will almost certainly invoke the magic of “machine learning”).</p>
<p>When this happens, it is <em>your job</em> to work with your stakeholder to identify the problem your stakeholder actually needs addressed.</p>
<p>“Wait, what?” you may say. “Isn’t it the job of my stakeholder to figure out what they need?” Yes, but… no.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, always remember that you will be evaluated on whether you have made your stakeholder’s life better, not on the complexity of your algorithms or whether your data visualizations are aesthetically pleasing. And the only way you can make the stakeholder’s life better is to successfully identify and solve a problem for them.</p>
<section id="positive-versus-normative-questions">
<h2>Positive versus Normative Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#positive-versus-normative-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Before we dive into each of these types of questions, it is worth pausing to emphasize that this is a taxonomy of questions about how the world <em>is</em>, not about how world <em>should be</em>. That’s because while data science is an amazing tool for telling us about the state of the world, it <em>cannot</em>, on its own, answer <em>should</em> questions. That is because answering <em>should</em> questions requires evaluating the desirability of different possible outcomes, and that can only be done using on the basis of a system of values. Data science may tell us the <em>consequences</em> of different courses of action, but it cannot tell us whether those consequences make a given course of action worthwhile.</p>
<p>To illustrate, suppose you are interested in reducing opioid overdoses. Your rigorous data science analysis may tell you that increasing the regulation of opioid prescriptions will reduce overdoses by some amount X and reduce access to opioids for those with chronic pain by some amount Y. But does that mean you should enact the policy? Well, that depends on how much <em>value</em> you place on patients with chronic pain having access to opioids, and how much <em>value</em> you place on preventing overdoses. And the answers to those questions simply can’t come from your data.</p>
<p>In this course, we will refer to questions about how the world <em>is</em> as “positive questions”, and questions about how the world <em>should be</em> as normative questions. But be aware these terms aren’t universal. Some people use the term “descriptive” instead of positive, and “proscriptive” instead of normative. Since we are using the term “descriptive” for a different purpose in this class, I will use normative and positive throughout this course to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>What’s The <em>Real</em> Problem / Need<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-real-problem-need" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>You might think that the on thing that the stakeholder knows best is nature of their problem. But one thing you will quickly find is that stakeholders will very often mis-identify or mis-represent their true problem / need.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are approached by a real estate group interested in developments in the United Kingdom. They tell you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We do a lot of work building large residential buildings. One problem we often have is that after we start digging the fundations of our buildings, we discover that we’re actually on top of ancient ruins of some sort that the stupid government wants to preserve for stupid posterity. Then we have to spend piles of money to have archeologists come to dig out these old bones with toothbrushes, all of which also puts us behind schedule. So what we want you to do is design a machine learning algorithm that we can use to detect archeological sites from the ground penetrating radar scans we do after we’ve cleared out a job site so we can avoiding digging foundations in the spots on our plots where archeological sites might be located.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So what does this stakeholder want you to do? At first glance, it might seem like the answer is “develop a machine learning algorithm for detecting archeological sites in ground penetrating radar scans”.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: most people ask data scientists for help because they don’t know much about data science. As a result, they specific thing they ask for may not actually be the best approach available given the state of data science.</p>
<p>In this case, for example, I would argue that the <em>real</em> need of this company is to know where archeological sites are likely to be located, full stop. Finding a way to identify archeological remains in ground radar scans might help them, but there are two problems with that approach. First, it’s not clear it’s feasable. Training a supervised machine learning algorithm requires labeled training data, which in this case would mean ground penetrating radar scans of identified-but-not-yet-excavated-ruins. And its not at all clear such data could be obtained.</p>
<p>But second, and more importantly, it seems like it’d be <em>much</em> more helpful and cost effective if you could make a guess about whether there are archeological sites at a location <em>before</em> the company buys the land and clears away the existing buildings!</p>
<p>So what would I propose to a stake holder like this? I would say: “If I could tell you the likelihood that an archeological site is under a plot of land *you’re thinking about buying, would that be more helpful to you?”</p>
<p>Now to be clear, you may not always be right in your assessment. They may come back and say “No, sorry – there’s this other consideration we didn’t explain initially” (like “we’ve already bought all this land. We’re committed.”). But before diving in, you always want to be sure <em>you’re solving the right problem.</em> And you should never <strong>assume</strong> that the problem to be addressed has been properly specified.</p>
<section id="what-questions-do-i-need-to-ask">
<h3>What Questions Do I Need To Ask?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-questions-do-i-need-to-ask" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Data science tools aren’t designed to solve problems; they answer questions. And so to have any hope of successfully solving the problem presented by your stakeholder, you must first determine what questions, if answered, would help solve the problem at hand.</p>
<p>In the example of the real estate development company above, for example, a question which, if answered, would make it essentially solve the stakeholder’s problem would be:</p>
<p><em>Can I predict the presence of archeological ruins using publicly available data, such as data topology, hydrology, soil types, and geography?</em></p>
<p>Unlike using machine learning to process ground penetrating radar scans, the training data required to build a supervised machine learning algorithm to answer this question – information on the locations of previously located archeological ruins – is likely public, and there are <em>lots</em> of public sources of data on landscape features and soil types. You would have to deal with the fact that people will only have figured out if archeological ruins are present in places where development has taken place in the past (so you’d want to build your training data using only the locations of large real estate developments that <em>would</em> find ruins if ruins were present), but this is emminently doable.</p>
<p>Again, I am not saying this is the <em>best</em> strategy – there may be considerations we don’t know about yet – but this approach is certainly something I would bring back to the real estate company before doing any actual data work.</p>

<h3>Make Your Questions Specific and Actionable<a class="headerlink" href="#make-your-questions-specific-and-actionable" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In developing your questions, it is important to make them specific and actionable. A specific and actionable question is one that makes it very clear what you need to do next. For example, suppose an international aid organization told you they were worried that urbanization in Africa, Asia and Latin America was impacting efforts to reduce infant mortality. Some examples of specific, actionable questions are: “Is infant mortality higher among recent migrants to urban centers, controlling for income?” or “are the causes of infant mortality among recent migrants to urban centers different from those living in rural area?” Reading those questions, you can probably immediately think of what data you’d need to collect, and what regressions you’d want to run to generate answers to those questions.</p>
<p>Vague questions would be “is urbanization impacting efforts to reduce infant mortality?”, or “does urbanization affect infant mortality?” Note that when you read these, they don’t seem to obviously imply a way forward.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to figure out if your question is answerable is to write down what an answer to your question would look like. Seriously – try it. Can you write down, on a piece of paper, the graph, regression table, or machine learning diagnostic statistics (complete with labels on your axes, names for variables, etc.) that would constitute an answer to your question? If not, it’s probably too vague!</p>
