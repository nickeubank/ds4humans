# Internal versus External Validity

It is at this point I have to come clean about having employed a... small indirection. At the top of this reading, I introduced the idea that answering Exploratory Questions boiled down to creating (1) understandable summarizations (2) of meaningful patterns in the data, (3) and ensuring they are faithful representations of the data. But that three part objective is actually only *one half* of answering an Exploratory Question. More specifically, those are the three components of ensuring high *internal validity* when answering an Exploratory Question, but to generate a useful answer, one must also have high *external validity*.

Essentially, *internal validity* is a measure of how well you have analysed *the data you have*, while *external validity* is how well you expect the answer you generated from that data to generalize to the context in which you actually hope to solve your problem. Internal and external validity arise when answering *any* data science question, and so these two concepts are ones that we will return to time and again in this book.

To illustrate what is meant by these terms, suppose you've been hired to...
