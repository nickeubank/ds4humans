# EDA: The Most Pernicious Term in Data Science

In our next reading, we will turn our attention to *Exploratory Questions.* First, however, it is important to have a candid discussion about what I feel is one of the most problematic concepts in data science education: *Exploratory Data Analysis* or *EDA*.

The problem with the term Exploratory Data Analysis is that, if you asked most data scientists what it means, they probably couldn't actually give you a straight answer. If you pressed them further, they would probably say something like "when you look at your data before you start fitting your models."

While the idea that data scientists should "get to know their data" before fitting a model is well-meaning (you *absolutely* should!), the ubiquitous but uncritical use of the term has given young data scientists the sense that the undirected poking at data is worthy of a capitalized three world title, complete with a universally recognized acronym.

This is problematic because *any* activity that involves data but lacks a clear motivation is doomed to be unending and unproductive. Data science has emerged precisely because our datasets are far too complex for us to understand directly; indeed, I would argue that the job of a data scientist can be summed up, in part, as a person who identifies **meaningful** patterns in our data and makes them comprehensible.

But therein lies the problem — without a clear motivation for *why* the data scientist is poking at their the data, what makes a pattern meaningful is undefined. And without a clear purpose from which a concept of meaningfulness can be derived, there is no end to the ways one can slice and dice the data with no way of knowing when to stop or what is useful.

I would argue that what most people call Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can actually be decomposed into two activities.

The first activity people call EDA is what I call "learning the structure of your data." This consists of answering questions about your dataset like "what constitutes a single observation in this dataset?," "what variables are included in this dataset?," "how many observations are there?," "how are variables coded?," and "what population is represented in this data?" These are questions about *the specific dataset* you are working with, *not* the real world, and answers are likely to be found in the dataset documentation and through basic tools for data introspection.[^pandas]

[^pandas]: In `pandas`, this would be things like `df.columns` to see what variables are in the data, `df.info()` to get a sense of how data is being represented and the number of rows, and simple tools for tabulating unique values like `df["first column"].value_counts()`.

The second activity people call EDA is... everything one does with the data before they fit a statistical or machine learning model. This is the second major reason that I feel the very concept of EDA has had a pernicious influence on data science — it implicitly devalues anything done with data that doesn't entail a complicated model as "lesser" or "just a stop on the way towards the "real" analysis," when nothing could be further from the truth.

This type of data analysis — looking at summary statistics, calculating distributions of variables, computing tabulations and cross-tabulations of different things to improve one's understand of the world — is categorically different from "learning the structure of your data," because it is inquiry in the service of better understanding the world, not the structure of your dataset. But it is *not* categorically different analyzing data using statistical models, not just because in many cases generating cross-tabulations or calculating group averages are essentially equivalent to using a statistical method like linear regression, but also because they are both examples of the same enterprise: attempting to answer questions about the world using data in the service of solving problems. And just as one cannot properly fit or tune a model without a clear sense of the question one is seeking to answer and how that answer is meant to be used, neither can one meaningfully calculate meaningful cross-tabulations or plots without having a sense of purpose that makes clear what constitutes "meaning."
