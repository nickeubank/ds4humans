But to be clear, you are not restricted to the precise problem articulation you used at the beginning of the semester; data science projects can — and should — evolve over time as you learn more about your case. In your last assignment, you answered Exploratory Questions in order to improve your understanding of your problem and to help prioritize subsequent investigations. The lessons learned during that process should inform what you choose to focus on now.
