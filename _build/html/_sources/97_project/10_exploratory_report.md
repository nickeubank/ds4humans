# Assignment 2: Exploratory Question Report

The second project assignment is to answer the Exploratory Questions laid out in your initial proposal. 

The report should be written according to the [principles in this document](../40_in_practice/25_writing_to_stakeholders) (which will be familiar to those of you who took *Practical Data Science*). Please start your document with a quick note on who you imagine as your stakeholder (a CEO, a public policy expert, etc.).

## Finding Data

To help you along your way, here's a [compilation of a huge number of public data sources](99_data.md). It's far from exhaustive, but a good place to browse if you're unsure how to answer one of your questions.

Still stuck? Let me know and we can brainstorm together.

## Due Date

Your Exploratory Question Report is due **February 11th**.
