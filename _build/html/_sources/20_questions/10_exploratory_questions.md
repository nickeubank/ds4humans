## Descriptive Questions

Descriptive questions are questions about the current or past state of the world. In the words of [John Gerring (we'll read more of his work for a future class)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123412000130): 

> A descriptive argument describes some aspect of the world. In doing so, it aims to answer *what* questions (e.g., when, whom, out of what, in what manner) about a phenomenon or a set of phenomena. Descriptive arguments are about what is/was. For example: "Over the course of the past two centuries there have been three major waves of democratization.

Of all the types of questions we will study in this class, descriptive questions tend to be the least appreciated, but I would argue that in many ways they are the most important. That is because descriptive analyses are often the foundation for all other work. After all, it is only by first understanding the patterns in our world can we then move on to asking questions about how they arrose, or how they may evolve in the future. 

To illustrate, let's consider a few important descriptive analysis: 

### Descriptive Example 1: Nope, This Time Isn't Different

A great example of descriptive analysis comes from economics. In 2011, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff published a book called [This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly](https://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691152640). In it, they comprehensively analyze hundreds of years of economic history across more than sixty countries to document how, despite pundits regularly decrying that "this time things are different," financial crises occur with remarkable frequency, duration, and ferocity. They offer some theories about why this may be, but their core contribution is documenting clearly that whatever it is that drives financial crises, it is not something specific to any geography or period, but rather something common to human economic systems the world over, wiping away dozens of attempts to explain specific financial crises as special cases in the process.


### Descriptive Example 3: Disease Surveillance

It is hard to think of a public health discovery that didn't start with disease surveillance -- the practice of keeping *descriptive* statistics about causes of death or disease. Efforts to understand HIV began when public health officials saw a huge rise in gay men dying from diseases that shouldn't have been fatal for young otherwise healthy men, and research into the role of cigarettes in causing lung cancer started when data showed that lung cancer rates were exploding across the world. 


### Descriptive Example 4: Global Warming

Before we began to develop a rigorous understanding of the dynamics that were causing our climate to warm, we first had to become aware that, well, our climate was warming! Yup, yet another current discipline that began with a "simple" (I put "simple" in quotes because there's nothing actually simple about measuring the temperature of the entire world over (initially) decades and (later) centuries) descriptive analysis: what is the temperature of the Earth, and how has it changed over time?
