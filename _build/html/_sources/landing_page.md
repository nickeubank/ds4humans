# Welcome to Data Science for Humans

The beginning of a textbook by [Josh Clinton](https://www.joshclinton.com/) and [Nick Eubank](https://www.nickeubank.com).

## Why Do We Need Another Data Science Book?

To many, Data Science is synonymous with terms like Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. As a result, many resources for learning data science are organized around the *tools* commonly used by data scientists.

We take a different perspective. In this book, we argue that Data Science is best understood as **the practice of *answering questions* about the world using computational methods,** and that any systematic approach to learning Data Science should be organized around the types of questions Data Scientists answer, not around specific algorithms or models.

We argue that nearly all questions the data scientists seek to answer can be divided into three types—descriptive or exploratory questions, classification questions, or causal questions—and that all problems that fall into each of these categories (and all tools designed to answer each type of question) share similar fundamental features.
