# The SEP field and *Life, The Universe, and Everything*

Nowhere is the power of the "somebody else's problem" construction as well documented as in Douglas Adams' [Life, The Universe, and Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Universe-Everything-Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy/dp/0345391829) (book three of his famous five book science fiction trilogy) in a scene involving Ford Prefect (an intergalactic traveler) and Arthur Dent (Ford's very human and very overwhelmed traveling companion) few things are as powerful at distracting attention as labeling them "somebody else's problem":

> "Something's on your mind, isn't it?" said Arthur.
>
> "I think," said Ford in a tone of voice that Arthur by now recognized as one that presaged something utterly unintelligible, "that there's an S.E.P. over there."
>
> He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking. > Arthur looked in the one direction, which was toward the sight screens, and in the other, which was at > the field of play. He nodded, he shrugged. He shrugged again.
>
> "A what?" he said.
>
> "An S.E.P."
>
> "An S...?"
>
> "...E.P."
>
> "And what's that?"
>
> "Somebody Else's Problem," said Ford.
>
> "Ah, good," said Arthur, and relaxed. He had no idea what all that was about, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn't.
>
> "Over there," said Ford, again pointing at the sight screens and looking at the pitch.
>
> "Where?" said Arthur.
>
> "There!" said Ford.
>
> "I see," said Arthur, who didn't.
>
> "You do?" said Ford.
>
> "What?" said Arthur.
>
> "Can you see," said Ford patiently, "the S.E.P.?"
>
> "I thought you said that was someone else's problem."
>
> "That's right."
>
> Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense stupidity.
>
> "And I want to know," said Ford, "if you can see it."
>
> "You do?"
>
> "Yes!"
>
> "What," said Arthur, "does it look like?"
>
> "Well, how should I know, you fool," shouted Ford. "If you can see it, you tell me." Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples that was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel. Ford took him by the arm.
>
> "An S.E.P.," he said, "is something that we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That's what S.E.P. means. Somebody Else's Problem. The brain just edits it out; it's like a blind spot. If you look at it directly you won't see it unless you know precisely what it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye."
>
> "Ah," said Arthur, "then that's why.."
>
> "Yes," said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say.
>
> "...you've been jumping up and..."
>
> "Yes."
>
> "...down, and blinking..."
>
> "Yes."
>
> "..and.."
>
> "I think you've got the message."
>
> "I can see it," said Arthur, "it's a spaceship."
>
> [...]
>
> They could now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it was there. It was quite apparent, however, that nobody else could. This wasn't because it was actually invisible or anything hyperimpossible like that. The technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a trillion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it. The ultrafamous sciento-magician Effrafax of Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great megamountain Magramal entirely invisible.
>
> Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux-O-Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-By-Pass-O-Matics, he realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn't going to make it. So, he and his friends, and his friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends' friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what is now widely recognized as being the hardest night's work in history and, sure enough, on the following day, Magramal was no longer visible. Effrafax lost his bet-and therefore his life simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when walking around the area where Magramal ought to be he didn't trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking extra moon.
>
> The Somebody Else's Problem field is much simpler and more effective, and what is more can be run for over a hundred years on a single flashlight battery. This is because it relies on people's natural predisposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting or can't explain. If Effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple Somebody Else's Problem field on it, then people would have walked past the mountain, around it, even over it, and simply never have noticed that the thing was there.
>
> And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast's ship. It wasn't pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything.
>
> The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small, upended Italian bistro.
>
> Ford and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensibilities.
