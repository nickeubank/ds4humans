    "But the way we'll mostly *use* R is with an application called [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). RStudio is a \"helper\" program that makes it easier to work with R (it is what is referred to as an \"editor\" or \"integrated development environment\" (IDE)). When you're working in RStudio, all the code you run is being run by R itself, but RStudio provides tools to make it easier to see what R is doing, to organize the code your write to run in R, to look at plots R generates, and more. In other words, you don't need RStudio to use R (some people use other editors, like VS Code), but you definitely need R to run RStudio, and any code you write in RStudio will work anywhere R is available. \n",

We will have lots of opportunities to practice what you've read, and I don't expect you to feel comfortable with any of this until you've had a chance do some exercises. Programming is a skill that you learn by doing. \n",

We'll get into material I feel confident will be novel soon.\n",

As a result, I don't want to just teach you how to chain together a handful of specific functions to do basic data manipulations.

    "\n",
    "But by learning the fundamental principles of *how* programming languages work, you'll develop a more robust, less \"brittle\" skill set that will provide you with a solid foundation for learning new tools over the course of your entire social science career. It may feel a little slow at first, but I promise it'll pay off over the years. "
