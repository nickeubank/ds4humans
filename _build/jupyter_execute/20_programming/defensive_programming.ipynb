    "# Defensive Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the social sciences have been struggling with a wave of papers that have turned out to have problems not because of problems of theory, or choice of statistical models, but rather because of simple programming errors. In perhaps the most embarassing, Steven Levitt (co-author of the acclaimed Freakonomics, and winner of one of the most prestigious awards in economics) had a paper about the political explosive (at least in the US) topic of abortion and crime that turned out to be wrong [because he hadn't put a set of controls into a regression he thought he had (may require sign-in, though I think you can see without paying).](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2005/12/01/oops-onomics) Moreover, as some of [my own work has shown](https://thepoliticalmethodologist.com/2014/12/09/a-decade-of-replications-lessons-from-the-quarterly-journal-of-political-science/), the replication packages that come with a substantial number of political science papers have problems, often generating results that do not match those in the published paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reading this, it's natural to think that the reason we find problems in the code behind published papers is carelessness or inattention on behalf of authors, and that the key to minimizing problems in our code is to be more careful. The truth, I have come to believe, is more subtle: humans are effectively incapable of writing error-free code, and that if we wish to improve the quality of the code we write, we must start learning and teaching coding skills that help maximize the probability our mistakes will be found and corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "I myself once firmly believed the fallacy that the key to preventing errors was \"to be more careful.\" Indeed, I fear this belief may have colored the tone of of my past work on this subject in unproductive ways. Over the last several years, however, my research has brought me into close contact with computer scientists, and I discovered that computer scientists' mentality about programming is fundamentally different from the mental model I had been carrying around as a social scientist. Computer scientists *assume* programmers will make mistakes, and instead of chiding people to \"just be careful,\" they have developed a battery of practices to address the problem. These practices – often referred to as \"defensive programming\" skills – are designed to (a) minimize the probability mistakes occur and (b) maximize the probability that mistakes that do occur are caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll cover a number of these defensive programming practices with an eye towards their application in the context of applied data science. I did not invent any of these practices, but you will likely find that the way I present them (and the use-cases I emphasize) will differ from most other presentations you will find online. That is because in this tutorial, I will focus on the type of applied data analysis common in the social sciences, natural science, or business analysis, rather than the type of \"software engineering\" applications where these methods are most commonly applied.

    "## Style Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting isn't just about aesthetics, they also make code easier to read. This not only helps other people read your code, but it will also help you recognize potential problems in our own code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few rules of thumb for good code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use informative variable names.** Don't call something `var212` if you can call it `unemployment_percentage`. Informative names require more typing, but they make your code so much easier to read. Moreover, including units in your variables names (`percentage`, `km`, etc.) can also help avoid confusion.\n",
    "- **Comment!** Comments help in two ways. First, and most obviously, they make it easy to figure out what's going on when you come back to code days, weeks, or months after it was originally written. And second, it forces you to think about what you're doing in _substantive_ terms (\"This section calculates the share of people within each occupation who have college degrees\") rather than just in programming logic, which can help you catch _substantive_ problems with code that may run without problems but will not actually generate the quantity of interest.\n",
    "- **Use indentation.** Indentation is a way of visually representing the logical structure of code -- use it to your advantage!\n",
    "- **Let your code breathe.** In general, you should put a space between every operator in your code, and feel free to use empty lines. Space makes your code more readable, as illustrated in the following examples:"

    "## Adding Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests are simple true-false statements users place in their code. A test checks for a certain condition (like whether the sample size in a regression is what you expect), and if the condition is not met, stops your code and alerts you to the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Why do I need to always check things? I know my data!* \n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the exercises we've done in this boot camp, we've been using small data sets that are easy to just look at. In the real world of data science and computational social science, however, you will be working with data sets with hundreds of variables and tens of thousands of observation. So you can never really *know* your data -- you only get to see bits and pieces through your analyses, plots, and summary statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "I like to think of working with data as being like exploring a dark cave. The documentation for the data is like an old dirty map of the cave system that *in theory* tells me the layout of the cave, but in reality is often out of date wasn't drawn very carefully. I can never see the entire cave system, but I can't turn on my flashlight and check to see if certain features match what I have on the map. If my map matches what I see, great! But sometimes the map won't match what I see, and those are the situations where I'm really glad that I stop to turn on my flashlight and look around. Tests are a way of automating those types of checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Yeah, I always check that kind of stuff by hand when I'm writing my code. Why do I need to add tests?* \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is four-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Tests are executed _every time your code is run_.** Most of us check things the first time we write a piece of code. But days, weeks, or months later, we may come back, modify code the occurs earlier in our code stream, and then just re-run the code. If those changes lead to problems in later files, we don't know about them. If you have tests in place, then those early changes will result in an error in the later files, and you can track down the problem.\n",
    "2.  **It gets you in the habit of always checking.** Most of us only stop to check aspects of our data when we suspect problems. But if you become accustomed to writing a handful of tests at the bottom of every file -- or after ever execution of a certain operation (I'm trying to always including them after a merge), we get into the habit of _always_ stopping to think about what our data should look like.\n",
    "3.  **Catch your problems faster.** This is less about code integrity than sanity, but a great upside to tests is that they ensure that if a mistake slips into your code, you become aware of it quickly, making it easier to identify and fix the changes that caused the problem.\n",
    "4.  **Tests catch more than anticipated problems.** When problems emerge in code, they often manifest in lots of different ways. Duplicate observations, for example, will not only lead to inaccurate observation counts, but may also give rise to bizarre summary statistics, bad subsequent merges, etc. Thus adding tests not only guards against errors we've thought of, but may also guard against errors we don't anticipate during the test writing process.\n",
    "\n",

    "We've already covered tricks to maximize the probability we catch our mistakes, but how do we minimize the probability they will occur? If there is anything I learned working as the Replication Assistant at the *Quarterly Journal of Political Science* testing people's replication packages, it is that authors should **never** transcribe numbers from their statistical software into their papers by hand. This was _easily_ the largest source of replication issues we encountered, as doing so introduced two types of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Mis-transcriptions:** Humans just aren't built to transcribe dozens of numbers by hand reliably. If the error is in the last decimal place, it doesn't mean much, but when a decimal point drifts or a negative sign is dropped, the results are often quite substantively important.\n",
    "*   **Failures to Update:** We are constantly updating our code, and authors who hand transcribe their results often update their code and forget to update all of their results, leaving old results in their paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do you avoid this problem? Use tools that will directly export your results into plain text or formatted tables you can use in the program where you are working, like [stargazer](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stargazer/versions/5.2.2/topics/stargazer) in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also suggest users not only do this for tables - which is increasingly common - but also statistics that appear in text. For example, to put a single number into $\\LaTeX$, you just generate the number you want to put in your paper, convert it to a string, and save it to disk as a `.tex` file (e.g. `exported_statistic.tex`). Then in your paper, simply add a `\\input{exported_statistic.tex}`call, and LaTeX will insert the contents of that `.tex` file verbatim into your paper. "
