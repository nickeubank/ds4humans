    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point in our course, we've mostly *used* functions without really thinking about how they work. And to some degree, that's by design -- as discussed in our earlier reading, you don't actually need to know what's going on inside the function. You only need to know the arguments you need to pass to it to get back the thing that you want. In that sense, function is kind of like a toaster: you put bread in, you get toast back; how the toaster is turning the bread into toast isn't really something you need to worry about.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in your career, you will often find it useful to write your own functions, and to do that we have to understand a little more about how functions work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we care about writing functions? Functions are useful when you want to execute a task over and over again, resulting in less verbose and more easily interpretable code. And as we learned in our [defensive programming reading](defensive_programming.ipynb), that will not only save you time, but it will also make it less likely that you will end up with errors in your code!\n",
    "\n",
    "**But wait... isn't that what you told me loops were for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! Both loops and functions are, broadly speaking, for the same purpose: helping write more succinct code when you're doing something similar over and over. The big difference is that with a loop you only really get one variable the changes with each pass, whereas with the function, you can generalize behavior a lot more. In addition, as you'll see, functions are a little more flexible and reusable than loops."

    "## A Note About Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a concept in programming called \"scope\", which refers to what variables are visible at a given moment of execution. If you write a function to only need to work with (a) the arguments given to the function, and (b) the variables that you define within the function, you don't need to worry about scope. And indeed, there's a whole philosophy of programming -- called *functional programming* -- that says that's the only way you should write a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I would recommend sticking to this approach. However, I would not be doing my duty as an instructor if I did not mention that functions can see variables that exist outside of themselves. For example, in our `add_1_and_double()` example above, if we'd added the line `doubled <- doubled + x` right above our return statement, the function would have been able to \"see\" that there was a variable `x` in the world outside the function, and that it had been assigned the value `5` and increment `doubled` by 5. But... That's a very dangerous method of programming, because if you write a function that way, the behavior of the function now depends on the values assigned to variables outside the function. So `add_1_and_double(5)` would return one thing if you had earlier defined `x <- 2` and something different if you defined `x <- 7`. So... don't do it? I just want to warn you that code written like that will run, but it's something you won't want to use unless you really know what you're doing."
