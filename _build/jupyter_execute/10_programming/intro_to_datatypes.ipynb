    "# Intro to Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the features of computers than can be frustrating to new programmers is their inflexibility, and one place this inflexibility is most evident is in the fact that programs like R store data as discrete *types*. In this section, we'll go over the four data types you'll encounter most -- `numeric`, `integer`, `character`, and `logical` types -- as well as what it means for R to have these distinct data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types and Their Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "The four types of data you'll encounter most in R are `numeric`, `integer`, `character`, and `logical`, and each has an important role to play in for the social science researcher. \n",
    "\n",
    "`numeric` data, as the name implies, is data that stores numbers. This may be people's ages or incomes, countries' GDPs and infant mortality rates, global temperatures, or survey responses on a scale from 1 to 7. `numeric` data supports mathematical operations, like multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "`integer` data is just a special kind of numeric data that only contains, well... integers! (e.g. 1, 2, 3). We won't worry much about `integer` as a special type in this bootcamp -- if something can be represented as an `integer` it can be represented as a `numeric` -- but sometimes you'll see it, so it's good to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "`character` data is text data. It could be something short, like a survey respondent's name, or something longer, like the content of a tweet or a politician's speech.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`logical` data takes on only two values: `TRUE` and `FALSE` (note those values have to be written in all capitals to be recognized by R!). `logical` data can store information about the world (you could have a variable called `female` that only has values of `TRUE` and `FALSE`), but more often we use it for evaluating our data. For example, suppose we wanted to test whether a survey respondent's age is over 18 to evaluate whether they are eligible to vote -- we'd probably do something like ask whether `age >= 18`, which would evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE`."

    "\n",
    "Unlike some programming languages, when you assign values to a variable, you don't have to tell R the type of data you're assigning in advance (this is definitely not true for all languages, and something that makes R much easier to use than many other languages!). Instead, R will make inferences based on what you've passed. Namely: \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you type out a number, R will assume it's `numeric`. \n",
    "  - (If you've worked in other programming languages, you've probably heard these referred to as `floats`.)\n",
    "- If you type out something and put it in double-quotation marks (`\"like this\"`), R will treat it as a `character`.\n",
    "  - (If you've worked in other programming languages, you've probably heard these referred to as `strings`.)\n",
    "- If R sees `TRUE` or `FALSE`, or an expression that is evaluated to `TRUE` or `FALSE` (like `7 > 3`, which is obvously `TRUE`) it will treat it as logical. \n",
    "  - (If you've worked in other programming languages, you've probably heard these referred to as `bools` or `booleans`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's play around a little. Note that we can always check the type of data by passing our data, or the variable to which the data has been assigned, to the `class()` function, which then returns the type of the input. For example:"
