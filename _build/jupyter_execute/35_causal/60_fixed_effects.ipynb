    "# Fixed Effects: Indicator Variables for Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "One common use of indicator variables are as *fixed effects*. Fixed effects are used when our data as a \"nested\" structure (we think individual observations belong to groups), and we suspect different things may be happening in each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset of student test scores, and students are all grouped into different schools; or perhaps we have data on earnings and gender across US cities. In these examples, individual observations can be thought of as being grouped into schools or cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "One option with this kind of data is to just ignore the groups. For example, if we want to know about differences in the academic performance of minority children across the school system, then we might not want to add controls for students' schools because we think that part of way race impacts performance is though sorting of minority students into worse schools. If we added school fixed effects, we'd lose that variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we were interested in understanding whether school administrators treat minority children differently, and whether this affects academic performance. Principles, for example, may be more likely to suspect Black children than White children. If that were our interest, then what we really want to know about is how race impacts academic performance *among students in the same school*. And that's where fixed effects are useful -- they let us control for group-level effects (like the fact all children in one school might tend to get lower grades) so we can focus on explaining *intra-group* variation (differences among children *at the same school*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, fixed effects are analogous in purpose to hierarchical models, though they are slightly different in implementation (differences between fixed effects and hierarchical models are [discussed here](fixed_effects_v_hierarchical.ipynb)). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Fixed Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's try and estimate how gender impacts earnings in the US using data from the US Current Population Survey (CPS) on US wages in 2019. We'll begin with a simple model of earnings:"

In a panel regression, the addition of entity fixed effects allow you to difference out any *constant* differences between entities, and focus only on changes within each entity over time. This even works for people! In a panel with individuals observed over time, adding individual fixed effects means you're effectively controlling for anything constant about each individual (things that don't change over time), and now you're just studying *changes over time* for each individual.

Clustering is a method for taking into account some of the variation in your data isn't coming from the individual level (where you have lots of observations), but rather from the group level. Since you have fewer groups than observations, clustering corrects your standard errors to reflect the smaller effective sample size being used to estimate those fixed effects (clustering *only* affects standard errors -- it has no impact on coefficients themselves. This is just about adjustments to our confidence in our inferences). \n",

    "## Computationally Efficient Fixed Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so everything we've describe up till here is a reasonable approach to fixed effects, but it has two limitations: our regression output looks *terrible*, and computing all those intercepts was slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to some of the specialized methods for calculating fixed effects. It turns out that if you aren't interested in the coefficient on each fixed effect, there are much more computationally efficient methods of calculating fixed effects. But to use them, we'll have to use a different library: [linearmodels](https://bashtage.github.io/linearmodels/doc/index.html) (installable using `conda install linearmodels` or `pip install linearmodels`).\n",
    "\n",
    "(R users: see note at bottom on doing this in R)\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we'll be using the `PanelOLS` function from `linearmodels`. As the name implies, `PanelOLS` is designed for linear regression (social scientists call linear regression Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS) with panel data, which is really any form of data organized along two dimensions. Normally a panel has data on many entities observed several times, so the first dimension is the `entity` dimension, and the second is the `time` dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we don't really have a panel—just nested data—but because fixed effects are commonly used in panels, we'll use this tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch is: you have to use `multiindexes` in `pandas`. I *know*, I hate them too. But the multi-index is required by the library for it to understand what variable constitutes the \"group\" for which you want to add fixed effects. Basically `PanelOLS` calls the first level of the multi-index the `entity` and the second level `time`. In this case, though, we'll just make the first level our counties, and the second level individual identifiers, then use `entity` fixed effects (and clustering)."
