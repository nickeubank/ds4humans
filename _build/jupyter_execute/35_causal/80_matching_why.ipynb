    "As we move forward, I'll be drawing a lot (including most figures) from [Ho, Imai, King and Stuart (2007)](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/preprocess.html) and two of Gary King's public lectures on youtube ([theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbrV-mM9mFk) and [implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvMyjDi4dyg)). I've streamlined his argument and tried to adapt it for the conceptual frameworks, language, and level of technical depth we're targeting in this class, but if you're really into this topic, that source material may be extremely valuable to explore.

    "The term model dependence refers to a situation in which the results of an analysis are sensitive to apparently small decisions made by the researcher in how they specify a regression -- for example, whether they include $X$ in their regression or $X + X^2$, or whether they use $X$ or $log(X)$ as an independent variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that \"model dependence\" is a condition that depends on the application. If you fit this model to predict $Y$ at $x=1.02315$, there's probably very little model dependence. But if you want to predict a value at $x=5$, there is. Something we'll come back to.\n"

It's made up, but let's pretend it comes from a consumer survey, where \"Treatment\" is whether the customer came to the store with a coupon, and \"Outcome\" is spending. Red T's are consumers who came into the store with coupons, blue Cs are consumers who came in without coupons. (Again: they chose whether to bring in coupons — this is not an experiment!)\n",

Well, the thing that should probably make us uncomfortable is that the way we drew that red parabola is that while we technically fit the model on the full dataset, the shape of that curve is being driven entirely by control observations (since there are no treated observations on either side of the education distribution). Our treatment observations played no meaningful role in the inverted U-shape that the model is estimating.\n",

    "In these observational causal studies, we often have far more control observations than treatment observations. Moreover, the control observations will often cover a much bigger range of your explanatory variables. If not many people get treated, it makes sense that the people who get treated may all look similar and so may fall into a smaller range of, say, education than the general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In these situations -- where, during matching, you get to keep all your treated observations because they all have close controls, but you drop some controls — then what you're estimating is the Average Treated on the Treated, which isn't half bad (it's often all we get with observational data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But the impact is a little more complicated if you have treated observations that don't look like *any* control observations. If you end up dropping both control and treatment observations during matching, then you're estimating an effect on... the sample of people in the range of explanatory variables for which there are both treated and untreated observations.

In matching, we are just conditioning on observatory variables differently.\n",
