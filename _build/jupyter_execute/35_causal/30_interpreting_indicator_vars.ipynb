    "# Using and Interpreting Indicator (Dummy) Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We often gloss over indicator variables in our statistics courses, but not only are they (in my view) one of the most powerful tools in a data scientist's tool box, but I cannot tell you how much I see people struggle with *interpreting* indicator variables in their regressions. So in this tutorial, I'll try to give them the treatment they deserve, and hopefully by the end, you've have a firm understanding not only of how to use *and interpret* Indicator Variables."

    "## What are indicator variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicator variables -- sometimes also referred to as dummy variables, though I don't know why -- are variables that take on only the value of 0 and 1, and are used to *indicate* whether a given observation belongs to a discrete category in a way that can be used in statistical models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, indicator variables can be used to indicate if an survey respondent is a woman (if the variable is 1 for women, 0 otherwise) or a Democrat (if the variable is 1 for democrats, 0 otherwise). In addition, as discussed in more detail below, collections of indicator variables can also be used to code categorical variables that take on more than 2 variables using a method called \"one-hot encoding). This allows use to work with variables that have many levels, like an individual's political party registration (which could be Democrat, Independent, or Republican). "

    "## The ONE thing that you must understand when using indicator variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you put an indicator variable in a regression model, there are two things you must always keep in mind about interpreting the coefficients associated with the indicator variable: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The coefficient on an indicator variable is an estimate of the average **DIFFERENCE** in the dependent variable for the group identified by the indicator variable (after taking into account other variables in the regression) and\n",
    "\n",
    "2) the **REFERENCE GROUP**, which is the set of observations for which the indicator variable is always zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you always remember that the coefficient on an indicator variable is an estimate of a **DIFFERENCE** with respect to a **REFERENCE GROUP** (also sometimes referred to as the \"omitted category\"), you're 90% of the way to understanding indicator variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recognize this may feel obvious, but trust me: I've literally reviewed papers from tenured faculty at major Universities that get this wrong. This is something people get confused about constantly, so I promise it's worth this treatment. \n",

The one group for which we do not create an indicator variable will become the **reference group** for the regression.

    "Interactions (at least when you interact an indicator variable with a continuous variable), just like a regular indicator variables, report **differences** between a group and the reference group. The difference is that instead of reporting the difference in **average value** of the dependent variable between the indicated group and the reference group, the coefficient on an interaction term is the average **DIFFERENCE** in the **SLOPE** associated with the continuous variable between the indicated group and the reference group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be concrete: let's suppose we think that turnout among men increases as they get older by a larger amount than for women. In other words, we think that turnout increases with age for both groups, but that there's a **DIFFERENCE** in the amount it increases with age. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test this, we need to create some interaction terms. But first, a quick note: when doing interactions, it's critical to not only include all the interaction terms that interest you, **but also all the variables in the interaction as stand-alone variables.** So for this we want `age` interacted with `female`. But while the coefficient on that estimate is what we're interested in, to get the right results we also need to include just `age` and just `female`."

    "And how does this vary with age? Linearly by $\\beta_1$ per year.\n",

    "Now we interpret `old_x_female` as the *difference* in how age affects men and woman. It is negative because, as we saw before, as women age, their turnout rate does not increase as much as men's. Here we find that men's turnout increases by 10 percentage points moving from under 50 to over 50. By contrast, when moving from under 50 to over 50, a women's turnout increases by -0.01 less (in total, it changes by 0.10 + -0.01 = 0.09).\n",
