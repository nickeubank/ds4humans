    "\n",
    "Today, you're going to get an opportunity to practice this approach as a group. To make things a little more interesting, though, I'm adding a small complication: the challenge of decoding stakeholder statements! This processes — a part of *stakeholder management*, something we'll read about in detail soon — is another core part of being a data scientist, because sadly our stakeholders are very rarely able to provide clear articulations of the problems they wish to solve. Indeed, to the contrary, they will often ask you to do things that don't make sense or make suggests sure to lead you astray.\n",

    "So for the following exercises, don't take the prompts I provide as gospel — imagine they are coming from a real person who may or may not be giving you the best guidance."

We want to keep innovating in this area. It seems like drowsy driving would be a cool thing to address.
