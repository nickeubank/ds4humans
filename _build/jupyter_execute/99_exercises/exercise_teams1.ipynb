    "Gather in your teams from last semester (from Andrea's class). \n",

    "Everyone on the team should identify **two** things from last semester they feel went well (*sustains*) and **one** thing they think could have been improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by going around in a circle, giving everyone a chance to state their three items. Everyone should get a turn to speak as you go around before anyone speaks twice — it's important everyone gets a chance to share their thoughts before you dive into any specific points raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "While going around, you may ask *clarifying* questions of the speaker, but our goal is to ensure everyone is heard, so please do not interrupt or get into longer discussions yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be constructive.** When discussing your \"improve,\" it's ok to cite how you felt about anything that may not have gone the way you wanted, but be sure to also provide a concrete suggestion for how your team's practices could be improved to address past concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After Everyone Has Shared\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to discuss what people have brought up. What points resonate with others? Does anyone have different ways of addressing issues that came up?"
